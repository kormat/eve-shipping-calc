TODO:
- write sanityCheck, check all stuffs, make errors
- ignore value for nullsec-only contracts
- unhardcode expiration/completion figures.
- make copyable values one-click-to-copy
- cleanup name-space, remove form_ prefixes from shit.

For debugging in chrome's console:
var scope = angular.element($("html")).scope()
scope.$apply();

Route/station selection algorithm:
- On init, route should be set to "Pick", pickup/destination should be set to none.
- When route is selected:
  - If pickup is still valid, don't change it.
  - Otherwise, set pickup to "Pick"
